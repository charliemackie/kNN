# kNN Basics
Leveraging kNN algorithm's to classify different data sets 

# Iris

There is a wieghted and unweighted method of determining which class a certain Iris should belong to.

In the unweighted method, the closest neighbors determine the classification of set instance. (Most common)

In the weighted method, the distance of each neighbor is assessed and given a weight which will help determine the classification of set instance.
